      "options": [
        "Twenty-two pairs are autosomes, and the members of a pair are homologs matched in length, shape and gene loci, one inherited from each parent.",
        "All 23 pairs are autosomes, and each pair is a set of sister chromatids.",
        "Twenty-three pairs of autosomes are present plus a separate pair of sex chromosomes.",
        "The pairing proves the cell is haploid, because each chromosome has one partner."
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "why": "Humans carry 22 autosome pairs plus one sex pair; homologs match in length and shape and carry the same loci, one copy per parent."

      "stem": "A cell with 2n = 6 has finished meiosis I and its two daughters are at metaphase II. How many chromosomes and chromatids does each daughter hold?",
      "options": [
        "6 chromosomes and 6 chromatids, because the set has not been halved yet.",
        "3 chromosomes and 6 chromatids, because each chromosome is still two sister chromatids.",
        "3 chromosomes and 3 chromatids, because the sisters have already separated.",
        "6 chromosomes and 12 chromatids, because the DNA was copied after meiosis I."
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "why": "Meiosis I halves the set to n = 3 but leaves each chromosome doubled, so 3 chromosomes carry 6 chromatids until anaphase II."

      "course": "AP Biology",
      "unit": "Metaphase II",
      "stem": "At metaphase II, the two sister chromatids of a chromosome attach to microtubules from opposite poles. Why are those sisters not genetically identical?",
      "options": [
        "Because DNA replication in meiosis II introduces new mutations into one sister.",
        "Because the sisters separated during anaphase I and then rejoined.",
        "Because crossing over in prophase I exchanged segments between nonsister chromatids, so the sisters carry different allele combinations.",

        "Cohesin is cleaved at the centromeres first, then along the arms in anaphase II.",
        "Cohesin is not involved; the spindle pulls homologs apart directly.",
        "Cohesin is fully degraded at the end of metaphase I, releasing sisters immediately.",
        "Cohesin is cleaved along the chromosome arms, while centromeric cohesin stays intact until anaphase II."
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "why": "Arm cohesin is cut in anaphase I to free the homologs; centromeric cohesin persists so sisters travel together until anaphase II."

      "unit": "One replication, two divisions",
      "stem": "Why is there no DNA replication between meiosis I and meiosis II?",
      "options": [
        "Because the chromosomes were already replicated in interphase, and a second replication would double the genome again.",
        "Because meiosis II is not a real division and requires no new DNA.",
        "Because replication happens during telophase I and is too fast to observe.",
        "Because each daughter cell replicates its DNA during prophase II."
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "why": "One S phase precedes meiosis I; replicating again before meiosis II would give each gamete twice the DNA it should carry."

      "options": [
        "Because each product receives a different number of chromosomes.",
        "Independent assortment gives different combinations of homologs, and crossing over puts different alleles on the chromatids.",
        "Because mutation occurs in every one of the four daughter cells.",
        "Because sister chromatids are identical and separate randomly at anaphase II."
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "why": "Assortment mixes which homologs travel together and crossing over mixes alleles along each chromosome, so no two products match."

        "Independent assortment at metaphase I, which mixes whole chromosomes.",
        "Crossing over between nonsister chromatids in prophase I, which makes recombinant chromosomes.",

        "Nondisjunction, which changes how chromosomes are distributed."

      "unit": "Random fertilization",
      "stem": "Why does random fertilization increase variation even though it adds no new alleles?",
      "options": [
        "Because fertilization creates new alleles by recombining DNA inside the zygote.",
        "Because the sperm selects which of the egg's chromosomes will be retained.",
        "Because fertilization doubles the chromosome number of each gamete.",
        "Because any sperm can fuse with any ovum, so the combination of two already-varied gametes multiplies the possibilities."

        "Meiosis I, because all four gametes are abnormal and the error appears in both products of the first division.",
        "Meiosis II, because only one of the two secondary cells produced abnormal gametes.",

        "Crossing over, because recombination changed the chromosome counts."
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "why": "A meiosis I nondisjunction sends both homologs to one pole, so both secondary cells inherit the error and all four gametes are abnormal."

      ],
      "answer": "C",

      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "why": "Eggs always carry X, so a Y-bearing sperm produces an XY male; gametes are haploid, carrying 23 chromosomes."
